# Contributing

We encourage pull requests, and will try our best to review and reply in a timely manner.

To develop:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Develop!
4. Test with `npm test`.

PRs should meet a few simple guidelines:

- All tests/linters must pass. It's ok if you need to rebase now and then.
- Please do not adjust version numbers. We'll do that when we publish to NPM.
- New features or bug fixes should include tests to ensure we never regress.
- Work should pertain to "validating uniqueness". Outside of this scope might be better served with another plugin.

Thanks!
